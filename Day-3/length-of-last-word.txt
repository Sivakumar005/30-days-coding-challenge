Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int n=s.length();
        int count=0;
        while(n-1>=0 &&s[n-1]==' '){
            n--;
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s[i]==' '){
                break;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
