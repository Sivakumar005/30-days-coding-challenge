Leetcode 187

Question:
The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        unordered_set<string>seen,repeated;
        int n=s.length();

        for(int i=0;i+10<=n;i++){
            string sub=s.substr(i,10);
            if(seen.count(sub)){
                repeated.insert(sub);
            }else{
                seen.insert(sub);
            }
        }
        return vector<string> (repeated.begin(),repeated.end());
        
    }
};
